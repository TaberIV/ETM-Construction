      <p>ETM Construction is an honest, reliable and quality firm.</p>

      <p>
        When we bid a project there are no hidden costs, the scope of work is
        broken down so clients know exactly where every dollar is applied. While
        most projects have detailed architectural plans allowing a firm cost to
        be obtained, some do not which opens the door to shocking extras; at ETM
        Construction we attach REAL allowances to the unknown because we are
        straightforward and our reputation depends on it.
