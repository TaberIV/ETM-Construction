      <h2>Build A Lifestyle</h2>
      <p>
        Located on Connecticut's Gold Coast, ETM Construction is a family owned
        and operated business that has been serving local home owners for over
        twenty five years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's new construction or a renovation, ETM Construction takes
        pride on delivering high quality workmanship, within a realistic and
        agreed upon timeframe and budget. My brother Alan and I have been in the
        building business for over twentyâ€“five years. We are both accomplished
        carpenters. We have been schooled in the entire building process by
        proficient local craftsman. This knowledge makes us exceptional project
        managers who supply a high quality project on time and on budget from
        foundation to punch list. ETM construction only hires local
        subcontractors who carry the proper insurances, licenses and permits.
        Our jobsites are well supervised we keep them safe, smoke free and
        organized which make for pleasant and productive working conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        ETM Construction is an honest, reliable and quality firm. When we bid a
        project there are no hidden costs, the scope of work is broken down so
        clients know exactly where every dollar is applied. While most projects
        have detailed architectural plans allowing a firm cost to be obtained,
        some do not which opens the door to shocking extras; at ETM Construction
        we attach REAL allowances to the unknown because we are straightforward
        and our reputation depends on it.
